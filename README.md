# Fantasy Football League Trophy Case App 

Web app built using Rails, Apollo, GraphQL, React and postgresql. 

I felt the tracking, in my league, of each player's stats in the Sleeper and ESPN fantasy football apps were lacking. I built this to show a simple, graphically straightforward representation of the current league champion and each player's relevant stats.

The rails backend and react frontend are in their own respective repositories in order to host on heroku.
