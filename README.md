# Fantasy Football League Trophy Case App

Web app built using Rails, Apollo, GQL, React and postgresql. 

I felt the tracking of each player's stats in the Sleeper and ESPN fantasy football were lacking, so I built this to show a simple, graphically straightforward representation of the current league champion and each player's relevant statistics.
